## Contributing

We welcome contributions!  
**For now, we are only accepting new medical calculation functions.**

### How to Add a New Calculation

1. **Fork this repository** and clone your fork to your machine.

2. **Create a new branch** for your calculation:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b add/my-new-calculation
   ```

3. **Add your calculation function:**

   - Open `calculations/calculations.py`.
   - Use the `@register_calc("Your Calculation Name")` decorator.
   - Write your function using clear, well-documented Python code.
   - Example:
     ```python
     @register_calc("Body Surface Area")
     def body_surface_area(weight: float, height: float) -> float:
         """
         Calculates the body surface area (BSA) using the Mosteller formula.
         Formula: BSA (m^2) = sqrt([height(cm) x weight(kg)]/3600)
         """
         return ((height * weight) / 3600) ** 0.5
     ```

4. **Add an entry to `data/calculations.json`:**

   - Open `data/calculations.json`.
   - **Find the category** that best fits your calculation (e.g., `"Medical Dosage and Administration"`, `"Patient Monitoring"`, `"Nutrition and Fluid Management"`, etc.).
   - If your calculation fits an existing category, add your calculation object to the `"calculations"` array for that category.
   - **If no suitable category exists,** you may add a new category object (ask a maintainer if unsure).
   - **Example entry:**
     ```json
     {
       "name": "Body Surface Area",
       "description": "Calculates the body surface area (BSA) using the Mosteller formula.",
       "formula": "BSA (m^2) = sqrt([height(cm) x weight(kg)]/3600)",
       "result_unit": "mÂ²",
       "parameters": [
         {
           "name": "weight",
           "description": "Patient's weight",
           "unit": "kg",
           "type": "float"
         },
         {
           "name": "height",
           "description": "Patient's height",
           "unit": "cm",
           "type": "float"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - **Place your entry under the most appropriate category** in the `"categories"` array. For example, if your calculation is about body measurements, add it to the `"Body Mechanisms and Growth"` category.
   - **Make sure the `"name"` matches the one you used in the Python decorator.**
   - **Fields required in each calculation entry:**

     - `name`: The calculation name (must match the Python function decorator).
     - `description`: A short description of what the calculation does.
     - `formula`: The formula used (in plain text).
     - `result_unit`: The unit of the result (e.g., `"mg/dL"`, `"mÂ²"`, `"score"`, etc.).
     - `parameters`: An array of parameter objects, each with:
       - `name`: Parameter name (must match the Python function argument).
       - `description`: Short description of the parameter.
       - `unit`: Unit for the parameter.
       - `type`: `"float"`, `"integer"`, or `"string"` (and optionally `enum` or `options` for choices).

   - **Example of adding to an existing category:**

     ```json
     {
       "title": "Body Mechanisms and Growth",
       "slug": "body-mechanisms-growth",
       "description": "...",
       "calculations": [
         ...existing calculations...,
         {
           "name": "Body Surface Area",
           "description": "Calculates the body surface area (BSA) using the Mosteller formula.",
           "formula": "BSA (m^2) = sqrt([height(cm) x weight(kg)]/3600)",
           "result_unit": "mÂ²",
           "parameters": [
             {"name": "weight", "description": "Patient's weight", "unit": "kg", "type": "float"},
             {"name": "height", "description": "Patient's height", "unit": "cm", "type": "float"}
           ]
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

   - **If you are unsure about the best category,** ask in your Pull Request and a maintainer will help you place it correctly.

5. **(Optional but recommended) Add a docstring**

   - Explain the formula and parameters.

6. **Test your calculation:**

   - If you have a test suite, add a test for your function.
   - Otherwise, you can test it by importing and calling it in a Python shell.

7. **Commit your changes:**

   ```sh
   git add calculations/calculations.py data/calculations.json
   git commit -m "Add Body Surface Area calculation"
   git push origin add/my-new-calculation
   ```

8. **Open a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Go to your fork on GitHub and click "Compare & pull request".
   - In your PR description, include:
     - The calculation name
     - A brief explanation of the formula
     - Example input/output if possible

---

**Note:**  
Both the Python function and the JSON entry are required for your calculation to appear and work in the app.

### Advanced Contribution Rules

- **Add calculation functions only in `calculations/calculations.py`.**
- **Add a corresponding entry for your calculation in `data/calculations.json` under the most appropriate category.** If no suitable category exists, you may propose a new one in your PR.
- Use the `@register_calc` decorator with a unique, descriptive name that matches the `"name"` field in your JSON entry.
- Write clear, readable code and include a docstring with the formula, parameter descriptions, and references if possible.
- Ensure your JSON entry includes all required fields (`name`, `description`, `formula`, `result_unit`, and `parameters`), and that parameter names/types match your Python function.
- Do **not** modify other files unless instructed by a maintainer.
- Do **not** add external dependencies.
- If your calculation is similar to an existing one, explain the difference in your PR.
- All code must pass linting and basic tests (if available).
- Be respectful and constructive in code reviews and discussions.
